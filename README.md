# Bark Analysis
*Last Updated 1/1/2022*

## Introduction
After having been down nearly 50% on my investment in $BARK, I decided
that it was in my best interest to do a more in-depth analysis on the
company before making a decision to hold or sell my position. In order 
to gain a better understanding of the company and stock, the analysis will
be split into two parts:
* Case Analysis
* Valuation Analysis

The case analysis will be used to learn more about the company and its management 
using various business analysis tools. The valuation analysis will be used to determine 
a price range for the value of $BARK stock given multiple cases.

## Disclaimer
I currently have a long position in $BARK
